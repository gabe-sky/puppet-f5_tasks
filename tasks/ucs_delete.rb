# This task deletes a ucs backup out of /var/local/ucs.  While the "save" action
# can take an arbitrary path, the delete method is limited to /var/local/ucs.
#
# This task requires several parameters to do its job.
#
# device_name:
#   The resolvable name of the f5 that you want to manage.
#
# device_port:
#  The port to connect to the API on.  Defaults to '443' if you omit it.
#
# api_user:
#   The username to authenticate to the API as.  Defaults to 'admin' if omitted.
#
# api_password:
#   The password to authenticate to the API with.  Defaults to 'admin'.
#
# file_name:
#   The file name of the backup to delete in /var/local/ucs
